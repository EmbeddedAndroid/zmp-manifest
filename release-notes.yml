highlights:
  - Bluetooth behaviors impacting MAC addresses are changed following Linux
    microPlatform update

summary: |
  The most significant change in this update follows the Linux
  microPlatform switch to a Linux v4.14-based tree. This impacts
  compatibility with any gateways relying on the old Bluetooth
  behavior, and also will cause changes to the MAC addresses reported
  by the Zephyr microPlatform sample applications. Users of the
  bt-joiner container whitelist feature in the Linux microPlatform
  will need to update their whitelists. Specifically, the leading
  D6:E7 in the MAC addresses must be changed to D4:E7.

      The major incompatible change is to the applications.

      No changes from upstream MCUBoot were merged. A subsequent
      udpate will pull in changes targeted for the next upstream
      MCUBoot point release.

      Zephyr includes a single bugfix.

        bug_fixes:
          - heading: LWM2M packet fix
            summary: |
              The LWM2M stack includes a fix which prevents a packet
              which may need to be retransmitted from being freed
              until after this retransmission has completed, if necessary.

        features:
          - heading: CONFIG_NET_L2_BT_ZEP1656 disabled
            summary: |
              This obscure option was used to preserve compatibility
              contrary to the Bluetooth specification with
              implementation characteristics in the Linux kernel. Now
              that the upstream Linux microPlatform was updated to
              v4.14, which has fixes for these characteristics, the
              option can be disabled.
          - heading: dm-hawkbit-mqtt cleanups and optimizations
            summary: |
              Various confusing implementation details in this
              application have been fixed and otherwise cleaned
              up. The resulting application now requires less memory.
        bug_fixes:
          - heading: Packet pool workaround for MQTT
            summary: |
              The dm-hawkbit-mqttt sample now uses an extra packet
              pool when the underlying link layer is Bluetooth. This
              keeps the network stack working in the face of IPv6
              packet header compression.
