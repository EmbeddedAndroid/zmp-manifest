  - "**Non-fast-forward** Zephyr update to 1.11 development tree"

summary: |
  The major change in this update is a non-fast-forward Zephyr
  repository tree based on the upstream 1.11 development tree.
parts:
  - name: Zephyr microPlatform
    summary: |
      "**Important note:** This is the first non-fast-forward update since
      the start of the 1.11 development cycle. The Zephyr tree is
      being merged into an updated OSF master with all outstanding
      patches cherry-picked onto the v1.10 tag. The Zephyr commits
      01287ca61 (new v1.11-based tree) and 06f1e76ed (old v1.10-based
      tree) have zero diff, and merging Zephyr trees into downstream
      trees can start there to avoid conflicts."

          - heading: Memory security improvements for ARC
            summary: |
              The ARC architecture has gained additional memory
              security support.
          - heading: I2C for STM32F0
            summary: |
              The STM32F0 SoC family gained I2C support.
          - heading: New Bluetooth testing API and cases
            summary: |
              Bluetooth grew a new testing API, and several test cases
              were merged.
          - heading: Board support and peripheral enablement
            summary: |
              Various fixes and peripheral enablement in the boards,
              across architectures.
          - heading: Ethernet improvements for mcux driver
            summary: |
              The mcux ethernet driver now disables promiscuous mode
              by default, and also implements IPv6 multicast group
              joining/leaving.
          - heading: Device tree bindings for sensors and I2C
            summary: |
              A generic yaml description for some sensors and I2C
              devices was added to device tree, along with other
              sensor- and I2C-related fixes.
          - heading: Legacy cleanups
            summary: |
              Thread groups were removed from the kernel, along with
              other cleanups in clocks and timers.
          - heading: Flashing/debugging changes
            summary: |
              The flash and debug infrastructure has been reworked to
              largely eliminate the use of environment variables. All
              board files were affected. Out-of-tree boards will need
              to be updated. Users of in-tree boards have been
              updated. User workflows that use the old environment
              variables will need updates.
          - heading: size_report changes
            summary: |
              Similarly to the flashing and debugging changes, the
              size_report script now uses command-line arguments
              instead of environment variables. User workflows that
              use the old environment variables will need updates.

          - heading: STM32F0 flash fixes
            summary: |
              The STM32F0 SoC family has fixes for the flash driver
          - heading: LWM2M fixes
            summary: |
              Several network fixes were merged for the LWM2M library.
          - heading: IEEE 802.15.4 fixes
            summary: |
              Fixes were merged for IEEE 802.15.4.
          - heading: Some BT Mesh fixes
            summary: |
              A few fixes and improvements were made to the Bluetooth
              Mesh app. The pace of fixes on this new feature appears
              to be slowing down, indicating greater maturity.

        manifest_project: zephyr-fota-samples
        bug_fixes:   # optional
          - heading: Fixes for blockages in the TCP stack
            summary: |
              The dm-hawkbit-mqtt sample reduced the TCP retry count,
              which prevents the TCP stack from blocking due to low
              memory conditions when many retry packets are in flight.
              This is a tradeoff between compliance with RFC
              recommendations for retry time and a working system with
              tight memory constraints.
